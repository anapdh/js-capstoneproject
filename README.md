## Game Design

- This game is an Endless Runner [Platform Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game).
- The platforms appear infinitely until the game ends and the game character (the bunny) has to jump from platform to platform;
- If the bunny falls from the platform, the game is over;
- Your progress (score) is measured by the number of stars you collect. Each star counts 10 points.
- To jump, you have to simply click on the screen with the left mouse button, or use whether the key up arrow or space in your keyboard. Clicking twice, you'll jump 2x (limit of jumps at once);
- If you have a score above 0 points, you can save your score to the leaderboard by submitting your name in the Game Over screen;
- You can check the leaderboard by clicking on the "Leaderboard" on the Main Menu or Gave Over Scene.
