## Game instructions

- This game is an endless runner platformer. The platforms appear infinitely until the game ends and the game character (the bunny) has to jump from platform to platform;
- If the bunny falls from the platform, the game is over;
- Your progress (score) is measured by the number of stars you collect. Each star counts 10 points.
- To jump you have to simply click on the screen with the left mouse button. Clicking twice, you'll jump 2x (limit of jumps at once);
- If you have a score above 0 points, you can save your score to the leaderboard by submitting your name in the GameOver screen;
- You can check the leaderboard by clicking on the leaderboard on the main menu.
